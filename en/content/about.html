          <h1>Barcelona 92: a worksite visit</h1>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>Barcelona Municipal Archive's contribution to the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, through this "Worksite Visit" web page, is the most tangible proof of what is now the history of the transformation of the city and the global resonance of the Olympic events. This heritage rests and is brought back to life from the shelves of the archives, to give us a first-hand account of the celebration of the Games and of how the execution of urban infrastructures was managed. So, years on and with total sincerity, the documents convey the great transformation of the seafront to remove architectural barriers, opening up the city to the sea, the revitalisation of Montjuïc Mountain with all the big sports infrastructures, carving out a new neighbourhood with the demolition of old factories and industrial buildings to make way for the Olympic Village, and other building projects in the areas of Vall d’Hebron, Diagonal, Meridiana, Plaça de les Glòries and the new ring roads around the city.</p>

		<p>The value of these documentary archives lies in the fact that they are textual, photographic, iconographic, unique and original documents, that are held and preserved mainly in the Contemporary Municipal Archive of Barcelona and in the Photographic Archive of Barcelona, two of the centres that form part of the City Council's municipal archives system which hold a diverse range of our city's valuable contemporary documentary heritage pieces in a number of different formats.</p>

		<p>Early on in the Olympic Bid process, Barcelona City Council took the unprecedented step of laying the foundations to collect and store all the documents relating to the Olympic Games from the different organisations and businesses involved, once the events were completed and the companies had received payment, in the Barcelona Municipal Archive, so that the process could be preserved and transmitted in its entirety to future generations.</p>

		<p>The documents from HOLSA (Barcelona Holding Olímpic, SA) and those of its affiliates IMPUSA (Institut Municipal de Promoció Urbanística, SA), AOMSA (Anella Olímpica de Montjuïc, SA) and VOSA (Vila Olímpica, SA), along with the documentation generated by the Olimpíada Cultural, SA (OCSA) were handed over to the Barcelona Municipal Archive by virtue of the transfer agreement signed in 1992. Also deposited in the archive in 1993 were the collection of general documents from the Barcelona '92 Olympic Organising Committee, in accordance with the agreement ratified in 2007, with the permanent transfer of all documentation.</p>

		<p>The majority of the textual documents are kept in the Contemporary Municipal Archive of Barcelona (more than 1,252 metres of documents spread across 49 shelves). As regards the documentation from HOLSA and the subsidiary companies, these are plans, graphic and textual documents produced in relation to the construction of the majority of the urban infrastructures, buildings and sports facilities linked to the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. As for the documentation from the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Organising Committee (COOB’92), this is comprised of textual documents connected with administrative management and the various activities carried out between 1981 and 1993.</p>

		<p>The photographic archive is held in the Photographic Archive of Barcelona and comprises images on a range of different subjects. This holding includes 265 photos generated through the activity of the company AOMSA; 25,081 photos produced through the activity of IMPUSA and 63,838 photos generated through the activity of VOSA. It also includes photos generated through the activity of OCSA relating to the revitalisation of the city's historic and artistic heritage, cultural creativity and the city's international profile; and 1,300 photos of volunteering events, from the Organising Committee for the Barcelona '92 Olympics (COOB’92). </p>  

		<p>Today the Barcelona Municipal Archive is joining in the celebrations and to mark the occasion, is handing this legacy over to the city through this website so that some of the most impressive aspects of the city's transformation for the Olympics can be relived, a demonstration of the Municipal Archives' inherent interest in providing access to and disseminating as widely as possible the documentary heritage relating to our most recent history.
